# Requirements for MySQL/MariaDB Import Script
# 
# Note: The import script now uses direct SQL commands via mysql/mariadb CLI.
# Python packages are no longer required for the import process.
# 
# However, if you want to run the example_queries.py script, you will need:
# PyMySQL - a pure-Python MySQL/MariaDB client library
pymysql>=1.0.0

# Optional: mysqlclient provides better native MariaDB support on Linux
# Uncomment if you prefer to use mysqlclient for example_queries.py:
# mysqlclient>=2.0.0
